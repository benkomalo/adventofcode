These are some of my solutions to [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com).

I used it as an opportunity to introduce myself to [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I took no care to make the code readable or pretty and don't expect this will be useful to anyone, but feel free to peruse if you'd like!

I also only started saving things after I decided I was actually going to finish the set, so the first couple are missing. Also - twelve is missing because it was JSON parsing seemed uninteresting so I did it in a JavaScript snippet in Chrome devtools.
